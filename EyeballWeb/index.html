    <h1> EYEBALL - In 1930s Period</h1>
    <p1> The 1930s were a time of economic and social upheaval, marked by the Great Depression that swept through much of the world. During this time, millions of people lost their jobs, homes and savings and struggled to make ends meet. Feelings of despair and hopelessness were everywhere, and many found themselves turning to film as a source of comfort and support. Films of the era often portrayed a world better than the one in which people lived and offered an escape from the harsh realities of everyday life. Whether it was a musical, a romance or a drama, movies offered a form of solace and entertainment that could help people forget their troubles, even if only for a few hours. In this way, movies played an important role in helping people cope with the challenges of the 1930s and provided a much-needed source of hope and inspiration in difficult times.
